# Do You Think What You Do Matters?

*Published: July 10th, 2025*

It's a deceptively simple question really. Do you?  

Each day you wake up, glance out a window (hopefully), and whatever the weather, you venture forth and undertake preset and dynamic tasks based on the life circumstances you find yourself in at that given time.

Do you stop and think for a second, why? To what end? Am I working towards something, is that thing worthwhile if so, and why not if not.

## The Bullshit

It's just after 6.20am on a Tuesday, you're tired, the neighbour's dog started howling again at 5am like it has often of late. 

As your eyes sting from the cold and strain against the darkness of the still morning, you make the genius decision to stop at a local cafe whilst dropping your partner at work. 

***Coffee***. 

Beautiful, that'll help. 

You step in, order your coffee and - 

>*"Nah but seriously! This kid man - I'm telling you - slurp - he's - 
he's the next big thing man. He's a fucking genius dude, already over in San Fran speaking to YC Combination - 
Y Combination - 
Y Combinators? 
You know, those tech guys, the VC guys. Yeah this kid is like - 
some sort of genius dude. I knew him from ages back, he actually came to me with his idea first but I was already too busy - slurp - crunch - 
was in talks with Maddy over at XYZ Capital and - 
actually man lemme tell you, I've got so many ***chats*** today dude. 
Everyone wants a damn chat, [insert diatribe of back to back name drops and talk of capital]".*

Wow, this guy is fucking obnoxious as.

And he doesn't, fucking, stop. 

The oddest part is his mates seem to follow the same formulaic dialogue tree in response, trying to assert that they too have so many ***chats***, they too have so many ***big things coming***.

A thought occurs.

*Do these people think that what they do matters?*

Simple, fundamental.  

Are they aware that even the world's worst barista is more inherently valuable to society than it's best VC tech marketing bro? 

That the service done to the local community by that barista is of incomparably greater utility to the whole than [reinventing the concept of buses because you can no longer scale your VC funded reinvention of taxis](https://www.wired.com/story/uber-just-reinvented-the-bus-again/).

## On the Nature of Jobs

Diatribe on jobs themselves and the inherent purpose behind them

Am I just a hater? Inherently? Yes, almost certainly. However, I'm also under no illusion that what I do (develop software) is any better. 

What is the point of a job though? At the core of it, a job serves two primary utilities: 
1. Income so person doesn't starve and die on the streets without a trust fund; and
2. It produces something that society has - as a whole, complex system - determined is handy right now, given the societal zeitgeist conditions the person finds themself in at the given moment.


I am not better than you, and any job is worthwhile in the system we live under

Some jobs are more meaningful though, frankly the average barista servicing the local community by slinging morning cups of coffee has more value to society as a whole than the next whiz kid Y Combinator schmuck receiving VC funding for an AI wrapper with a pretty homepage and marketing spiel.

## Fertig 

Really I'm just writing this because I was annoyed that a group of morons was too loud in a cafe I was getting coffee from, on an arbitrary day in the July winter of Melbourne, after getting up early to run an errand before work.
